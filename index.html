      <p>I keep most of my stuff on their respective platforms; videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jumpsplat120">Youtube</a>, writing on <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/jumpsplat120/">Archive of Our Own</a> or <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/profile/336349">Royal Road</a>, for example. If you want to view my stuff, look me up on the popular sites under "jumpsplat120"! I don't have an account everywhere, but 99.5% of the time, if you find a "jumpsplat120", it's me! (I've only ever found my name to be taken by someone one time so far, and it was on a gambling site of all places.)</p>
