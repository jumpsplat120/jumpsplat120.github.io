		<p>Woke up in a cell, no memory, and a scar on the back of the neck. A man in the cell next to us (who calls himself Derrick), gives us some info. We're in the dungeon of a man Kristopher Monroe, who has us under lock in key, supposedly extra judicially. A city called Tanrath (which contains a number of vampires), in the neighborhood of The Greens, is where both we, and the dungeon, are located.</p>
<p>We all seem to have dark vision, but other than that, we don't know anything about who are or what we were doing prior to this. We know pieces, such as how to eat, breath, walk and talk, but are missing anything that would allow us to navigate this new world.</p>
<p>Soon upon waking, commotion from above was heard, and I could smell smoke. My cellmate threw their weight against the gate, and managed to crack us out with an intense strength that belies their smaller frame.</p>
<p>Just we managed to break free, a guard(??) named Phoenix, who Derrick seemed to recognize, showed up, seeming startled at both Derrick, as well as our sudden entry in to the hallway. However, it's possible that they weren't a guard, but actually someone who was breaking Derrick out, as their appearance lends credence to them having started the fire, as well as them having keys to open up the locks for all of us.</p>
<p>Breaking into the first room, I find a sigil on the floor, as well as a bookshelf. I grab a book titled "Abyssal Entities", an arcane grimoire, and what seems to look like a journal.</p>
<p>The next room is some sort of storage, and while our rescuer had nabbed most of the potions, I managed to grab a couple some unknown potions as well, caring little for the safety of them.</p>
<p>Bringing us up to the second floor, we are assaulted by the smoke, and our "rescuer", heedless of the danger, heads in the direction of the smoke is event more thick. They claimed that the smoke was meant to cover our escape, but it seemed to do as much harm as good to me, as we made our way through the many hallways of a opulent building. Taking a breath at just the wrong time, I find myself coughing and hacking, barely able to make my way outside. However, my cellmate, after just a touch, manages to help, with some sort of strange ability. Phoenix as well was able to help me through the flames, making the rest of the escape through the smoke less difficult. Our escape however, ended up being less than subtle, as a large plume of smoke marked our freedom.</p>
<p>Not only was our fleeing marked by a huge pillar of smoke, but a guard spots us as well, just as we are making out way out of the gate. However, Derrick shifts into the form of a werewolf, and immediately charges the guard, taking a swing at him with beast claws, slashing at him before he has a chance to react.</p>
<p>My cellmate (now going by Vi), with the air of a practiced action, cuts themselves and phases out of reality, only to appear behind the guard, brandishing the weapon. With a flick of their wrist, the dagger flashes into the neck of the guard, burying itself up to the hilt, and extinguishing their life.</p>
<p>After the display of brutality, we quickly find ourselves in the wet, cobbled streets of The Greens of Tanrath. We stand out like sore thumbs, as those around us are markedly of a higher class, and our rough escape, and poor dress has us looking like peasants. Even without shoes, however, I don't find myself uncomfortable, as though I'm used to living in somewhat rougher conditions. We duck into an alley to collect our thoughts. But only moments after mentioning of a safe house, we hear the howls of "hound wardens". Both Derrick and Phoenix seem very worried upon hearing the howls, as they tell us that they shouldn't be in The Gardens. We all attempt to make ourselves inconspicuous, and Vi melts into the shadows, as though she is made of them.</p>
<p>And yet, even with our stealth, rounding a corner, we find ourselves 40 feet away from a nightmarish creature. While it contains the form of a hound, it's made of dripping blood and viscera, as though pulled from the nightmares of the prey of a hound beast. Our rescuer quickly throws out a cone of flame, hitting the bloodhound to seemingly little effect.</p>
<p>Looking at this creature, I feel a kinship, unlike anything else I've felt since. I take a step towards the bloodhound, with my hand outstretched, confident in this gut feeling. It bounds towards me, and nuzzles into my outstretched hand, then stands between me and phoenix, clearly forming a barrier between me and Phoenix.<br><br>Knowing that we are already quite conspicuous, I reach towards the puppy, attempting to impress upon it the idea of stealth. Then, as though I've done it many times before, I make a hand motion, and the hound sits on its haunches, and swirls into a form of liquid viscera, before being absorbed into my being.</p>
<p>After our sudden, but hopefully peaceful meeting with my hound, we continue towards the safe house. From our vantage, we see a view of the city; vast and technological, with signs of industry around. Smog exits a number of buildings and constructions, and we slowly make our way down towards the streets, and away from the land of the wealthy. Derrick and Phoenix let us know of some of the current political state. The castle that Derrick spoke of earlier is a prominent feature within the city, and she speaks of The Crimson Queen, Trysdomere, who's been ruling for the last 60 years. However, beyond the city is mountains, which are desolate lands. Other than the mountains, there's another city nearby, called Cyherested, which is ruled by blood mages, bot we are otherwise isolated from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Derrick mentions that they had previously been attempting to use shut down the "Nexus Matrix", a device controlled by a vampire named Cerci Wolfe, and being used to keep the sky in a state of permanent dreariness, so that the vampires have free reign of the city. However, after being captured, he was transferred to the "care" of Monroe, for reasons both he and Phoenix are still unsure of. While talking about the state of the old world that our new selves seem to find ourselves in, we find ourselves at a somewhat upscale in, called the Golden Boar. After using a complicated knocking pattern on the door inside the inn, a man named Gabe opens the door and, grasps him in a hug, relieved that Derrick is still alive. Seemingly the partner of Derrick, Gabe ushers us inside after a moment of reunion between the two, finally culminating our journey into the safehouse.</p>
<p>After a brief meeting of those in the safehouse, we get to hear the tale of the escape from Phoenix's side; getting info from a worker at Monroe's estate, using a fire as a distraction and getting their hands a set of keys, and using the smoke as cover to flee. However, it's definitely embellished from the panicked fleeing that we feel like we took part in.</p>
<p>While those of the "rebellion" take a moment to revel in the success of the rescue, me, Shoulders and Vi talk of the potential of Shoulders being vampire. Gabe looks a bit like Shoulders, and so I take the opportunity to try to subtly poke at the idea, seeing if vampires are all dangerous, or ostracized from general society. After being very unsubtle, I find that Shoulders is not a vampire, but is actually a Crimson, a race that has come about from the presence of vampires, anxt crystals (blood crystals), and blood mages. While sunlight hurts the eyes, and blood is needed to be sustained, they're not truely vampires.</p>
<p>Pulling Shoulders over, I fill him in on the information about being Crimson, and let the two converse for a bit. While half listening to the conversation, I close my eyes. Feeling the energy of the room and those within it, it's as though I could still see, and I could <em>feel</em> the location of Phoenix. While interesting to learn more about what I could do, desperately needing rest from the escape, and the activities that stole our minds, I follow Shoulder to the room that were offered to us by the rebels.</p>
<p>The dream is less of a dream, and more like fractured memories. My dreams entail being in the wilds beyond the city walls, fighting for my life, accompanied by Shoulders. The figure we're fighting against is like liquid smoke, and I'm unable to focus on their form, or make out any details. When I finally manage to wake, I find that I had slept for nearly half a day, and having arrived at the Boar in the middle of the day, it's now 2am.</p>
<p>Having woke up at such an odd hour, all three of us take a moment to recount our various dreamlike memories, gaining more puzzle pieces to our fracture history, but not enough to yet piece together a picture. We also update my name from Elf, to El. Vi takes the opportunity to go back to bed, while Shoulders begins meditating. I however, dive into the various books I had taken from the Monroe Manor.</p>
<p>Looking first at the journal, I find it is various notes on a summoning ritual. The journal contains notes on how the ritual was summoning an Abyssal demon named Dras'nat, and would "scrub our souls clean", and how they wanted to have us on "their side". However, due to the pronoun game and lack of specifics, it's unclear who "we" is, or what side that entails. An interesting note is that the process should have take a few days for us to recover from, but according to the timeline given to us by Derrick, we had escaped only hours later.</p>
<p>Looking into the grimoire, it was mostly a number of spells I knew very little about, but also included the nitty gritty on the specific ritual that was performed on us. Lastly, the Abyssal Entities book contains info on Demon princes, and also info on Dras'nat. Dras'nat exists in the demonic hierarchy directly underneath the princes, as a warlord of sorts. This gives him control over a large domain, although not exclusively. After pouring through the various books, I take the opportunity to go back to bed, this time to a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, all three of us make our way downstairs to a sleepy Phoenix, who updates on information about the Monroe estate. Apparently, due to the fire, they'll be under repairs for a bit, and we won't be easily get a hold of Kristopher. I ask Phoenix to point us in the direction of someone who can take a look at our soul, to get a better handle on what "scrubbing us clean" entails, and they claim that the best option we have would be to get to a bloodmage. They claim that they're not "all bad", and point us towards to someone on 2nd St. and Maple Ave.</p>
<p>Having finished up breakfast, Phoenix leads us downstairs towards a hatch at the corner of one of the rooms, which opens up into a ladder leading to the level below, to a sectioned off area of the ground floor of the Boar. A panel slides aside, revealing a part of the actual inn. Phoenix leads us into an office, where we see a portly dwarven man with reading glasses, who is writing most likely information keeping the business afloat. He introduces himself as "Jeremy", and quickly begins taking our measurements, to outfit us in some gear more protective than classic commoners clothes. "Come, come", he says, as he leads us into a room with a plethora of armaments and gear. Getting a chance to browse a large amount of weapons, I feel my way through a number of weapons, using the opportunity to see what feels the most natural. Upon picking up a firearm, the curve of the handle slips into my hands as though it had a thousand times before. Suddenly, I feel more confident in my ability to keep myself safe. I quickly scan over the weapon, getting a feel for the resistance of the trigger, the latch holding the cylinder closed, the spring of the hammer.</p>
<p>We eventually all get fitted out with a set of basic weapons and gear. No longer do we look like a motley crew of prison escapees, but more like the group of powerful adventurers we're beginning to realize we are. Among us, we've got roughly 400 gold worth of gold with out angst crystal, which Phoenix mentions is probably enough for us to make our way to the bloodmage Barry and get checked up.</p>
<p>Making our way out onto the streets for what feels like the first time, we are able to get a better look at Tanrath. The streets are cobbled and damp, and densely packed with buildings and people. Atomatah move about the city, and various merchants flash various magics to entice consumers into buying their wares. Following Phoenix's direction, we find a building that appears more like a mechanics shop than a doctors. Phoenix calls out for Barry, and a gnome appears from the various mechanical stuff strewn about, and after taking a few more minutes to finish up their project, pop out of the attic and <em>drifts</em> back down to the ground.</p>
<p>Barry makes his way towards us, and after a short conversation between him and Phoenix, comes to the conclusion that he could "probably" figure out what's wrong with us, and, after some bartering, he brings me back into a ritual room. There's a bunch of prescribed various rituals set up, and he gestures towards a chair that I sit down on. He begins chanting in a language I don't recognize, and I feel like someone is turning me around and looking at every single piece of me. As he looks past my flesh, towards my soul, he grabs a piece of paper and pen, and begins furiously scribbling down notes. "You're missing <em>a lot</em>. Roughly 65%." he claims. "If you could get your hands back on the soul, you might be able to patch it back together", he says, but Roland pipes up about the soul soup and Dras'nat, and Barry claims that it's pretty unlikely our pieces are still in one piece. What's more, Dras'nat is most likely an even bigger issue, as wherever he goes, he causes destruction and chaos. Barry claims that Dras'nat would most likely be linked to an avatar, if he was tied to the realm. With these leads, we head back out into the city of Tanrath, and to our new lives.</p>
